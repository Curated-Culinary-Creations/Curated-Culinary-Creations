# Curated-Culinary-Creations
 When the user click on a button, it gives a random generated receipt

Created by Aoife Mulligan, Tiara Brown, David Stokes, and Cedric Vallieu.

This is for those dealing with the pandemic and who want to spice up their at-home food choices, or those who just have trouble making up their mind for their meal of the day. We will use three different food variations such as Mexican, American, or Italian as the user's choices. They will be able to click on a button to generate a random recipe of their choice. We will incorporate local storage so that the user can come back to the recipe of their choice, and allow an option for a recipe of the weekday. For the recipe of the weekday, they will choose what food style they want for that day of the week and save that information so that they can come back to it. The recipes that we use will come from an API, and we will be adding elements that let you choose a drink and dessert along with restricting foods the user may be allergic to. Images will also be added to show the final product. 

MVP: Create a clickable website for a random recipe generator.
