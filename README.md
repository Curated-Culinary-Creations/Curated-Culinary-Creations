# Curated-Culinary-Creations

 When the user clicks on a button, it gives a random generated recipe.

This was created by Aoife Mulligan and Tiara Brown.

This is for those dealing with the pandemic who want to spice up their at-home food choices, or those who just have trouble making up their mind for their meal of the day. The user will be able to click on a button to generate a random recipe with an addition of their choice of a drink or dessert. We will incorporate local storage so that the user can save the recipe they saved and come back to that information on a different page. On that seperate page, the user will have the ability to remove an item that they do not want to be saved anymore.

MVP: Create a clickable website for a random recipe generator.
